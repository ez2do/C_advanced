Today I want to share 3 unusual research-backed ways to improve your ability to focus.

We all know the importance of focus in working towards our goals in life.

Whenever I think about focus, it reminds me of the story about the tortoise and the hare.

As most of us know, the tortoise and the hare is a timeless fairy tale.

It involves a race between two characters, a tortoise and a hare.

The tortoise moved slow and steady, and the hare was so fast that he became arrogant about his speed.

The version I was always told growing up involved the hare racing so far ahead of the tortoise that he decided to take a nap under a tall tree.

By the time the hare wakes up, the tortoise has managed to win the race!

I think the real intent of the story was to highlight the hare’s arrogance and the turtle’s persistence.

However, the lesson I got from this tale was different than most.

I thought that the tortoise won because of his ability to FOCUS!
