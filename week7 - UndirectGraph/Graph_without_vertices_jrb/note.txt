- use symbol table to represent visited[] array
	+ include symtab.h, define (*makeNode) and (*compare) 
	outside symtab

- (int*)jval_v(node->key) not convert to int*
==> instead, use int k = jval_i(node->key);
				 then pass &k to the function

- It's neccessary to add 1 egde 2 times. For example, add (0,1) and (1,0)

- Want to reassign a pointer, use pointer to pointer

- Forget about Symboltable, jrb is easier to implement
